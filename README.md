# ArchiveOrgAutoSaver
Sometimes, while browsing archived pages on the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://archive.org),
you might encounter pages, that haven't been archived yet. In those cases, this page might show up:

![Wayback Machine doesn't have that page archived.](https://potcfdk.github.io/ArchiveOrgAutoSaver/savepage-screenshot.png)

If you plan to add a bunch of pages, manually clicking the link can get pretty annoying.
This userscript auto-clicks "Save this url in the Wayback Machine" when a missing page was visited.
